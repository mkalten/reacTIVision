reacTIVision 1.6
————————————————
* added new Yamaarashi 20bit fiducials
* enabled alternative amoeba symbol sets (default, small, tiny)
* fully implemented /tuio/2Dblb profile to detect plain blobs, 
  plus optional blobs for fingers and fiducials
* improved precision and robustness of finger tracking
* improved angle and position resolution of fiducial tracking
* optional 1EUR filter to avoid position and angle jitter
* integrated the TUIO 1.1 library
  allows alternative UDP,TCP, Web and Flash transport
* converted portVideo into an external LGPL library
  - allow camera selection during runtime (press K)
  - process all available cameras and image formats
  - extended camera configuration options
* completely removed SDL dependencies for all non-GUI classes
* removed the classic fiducials and legacy amoeba tree
* removed the alternative MIDI functionality
  (this should be provided by an external TUIOtoMIDI converter)
